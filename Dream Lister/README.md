Based on Udemy's course [“iOS 10 & Swift 3: From Beginner to Paid Professional”](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10/learn/v4/t/lecture/5619384)

A wish list app:

- CoreData: entities, relationships, NSManagedObject, NSFetchRequests, NSFetchedResultsController
- UI: Tableview, segments, IBInspectables for custom Views.
- Table: insert, delete, update, move rows.
